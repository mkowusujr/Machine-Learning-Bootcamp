# How Data Scientist solve problems
1. Forumulate the Question
2. Gather the Data
3. Clean the Data
4. Explore and Visualise the Data
5. Train the Algorithm to identitfy patterns in the data
6. Evaulate the results

# Forumulate Movie Question
--How much money will our movie make?--
--How mch revenue will our movie make?--
Can we use movie budgets to predict movie revenue? We can measure this

# The Forumla
The regular line formula is y = mx + c
In machine learning it is the following
![machine learning formula]('basic-formula.png')
h means Hypothesis

With linear regression we want to find the line with the smallest residuals
h(x1) is our fitted value
(y1 - h(x1))^2 + (y2 - h(x2))^2 + ...
