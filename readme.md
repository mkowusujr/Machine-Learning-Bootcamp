# Intro

## What is Machine Learning

Laziness drives programming. A desire to get computers to do work so we can relax.
In Machine Learning we want to teach the computer to recognize certain things by giving them many examples.

## What is Data Science

Turning data into value.

### Data mining

Extracting patterns from data.

### Data Science

Combines data mining and computer science and is used to make predictions and make insight.

## How Data Scientist solve problems

1. Forumulate the Question
2. Gather the Data
3. Clean the Data
4. Explore and Visualise the Data
5. Train the Algorithm to identitfy patterns in the data
6. Evaulate the results
