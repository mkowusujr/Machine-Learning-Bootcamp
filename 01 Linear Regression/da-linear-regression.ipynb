    "In with this strategy we draw a line through the data points. Then we measure the vertical distances from the actual points and our regression line, these are called the **resdiual**. Then we add up all our measurements. The best regression line we be the one where the sum of the distances is as small as possible.\n",
    "The formula usually used is $MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum(y - \\hat y)^2$. Also known as the **Mean Squared Error**. The answer is also refered to as the **Residual Sum of Squares**.  \n",
